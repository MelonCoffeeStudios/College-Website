	<div class="h1">About Me</div>
	<div class="p">Hi. I'm Aaron Griffin. You may know me as the future designer of <b>your</b> website...<br>
		I am currently learning creative IT to a level 3 at DevelopEBP in Norwich. Here I have learnt and expanded my knowledge of the inner workings of web architecture. <br><br>
		I believe that it is important to have a strong, flowing and elegant website for almost any business. As a poorly designed website <b>will</b> scare off customers...<br><br>
		It is because of this I spend a lot of my time learning to create better and more responsive websites!
